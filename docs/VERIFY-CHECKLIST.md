# Verify Checklist

Merged and released features awaiting the owner's on-device verification,
grouped by release version (newest first). Each item notes whether it needs
app testing on a device or broker-behavior confirmation.

When an item is verified, move it to [DONE.md](DONE.md). When cutting a
release, the section for that version is the device-test punch list.

## Unreleased (on main past v0.0.137)

- **`--with-ntfy` bootstrap + `features.ntfy_url` advertise** — `remote-bootstrap.sh
  --with-ntfy` installs ntfy alongside the broker and the broker advertises the
  endpoint in capabilities. PR #484. [bootstrap + broker; needs device test of
  UnifiedPush auto-configure flow on Android]
- **opencode real-provider via env_passthrough + host-cred mirror** — opencode
  reads host API keys / configured providers; OAuth-only users still fall back to
  Zen. PR #485. [broker behavior; verify opencode session starts against real
  provider when key present]
- **ACP protocol research doc** — wire facts + conduit backend design notes for
  ACP. PR #486. [docs only — no device verification needed; move straight to
  DONE.md]

---

## v0.0.137

- **"Queued Next" steer UI** — codex turns get a ↳Steer injects mid-turn into the
  running turn; claude and others show "Queued" and auto-send on turn completion;
  send button shows steer glyph during a codex turn; gated on
  `capabilities.supports.steer`. PRs #481 / #482 / #483. [app, on-device]

## v0.0.136

- **Optimistic-send pending/failed bubbles persisted across kill** — unsent
  messages survive app kill and are retried on relaunch. PR #479. [app, on-device]
- **Codex model-row dedupe + recents capped at 3** — picker no longer shows
  duplicate model rows; recently-used list capped at 3 entries. PR #476. [app,
  on-device]
- **Connection-health banner + post-pair readiness checklist** — broker
  post-connect `/api/capabilities` readiness block; app banner and checklist UI.
  PR #466. [app, on-device]
- **Multi-box push registration** — device token registered with all paired boxes,
  not just the active one. PR #472. [app + push; verify push arrives from a
  non-foreground box]
- **Codex `turn/steer` server-side auto-steer + `turn/start` fallback** — broker
  auto-steers a running codex turn when steer arrives; falls back to turn/start
  if steer unsupported. PR #480. [broker behavior]
- **Choice-card awareness-prompt nudge** — agents receive a prompt nudge to emit
  choice cards at appropriate points. PR #478. [agent behavior; verify nudge
  fires and agent responds with a choice card]
- **Codex extra approval/elicitation server-request handling** — broker routes
  `item/fileChange/requestApproval`, `item/tool/requestUserInput`, and
  `mcpServer/elicitation/request` to the app. PR #473. [broker; verify card
  appears in app for each type — see also Now backlog item]
- **opencode 2-min silence timeout** — broker kills an opencode turn after 2 min
  of silence instead of 10 min. PR #471. [broker behavior]
- **Model-catalog richness — usage hints + fast-mode availability label** —
  `/api/capabilities` carries usage-rate hints and `supportsFastMode`; picker
  shows them. PR #475. [app, on-device]
- **Broker-version ldflag** — `/api/capabilities` reports the real semver tag
  (not `"dev"`) for broker binaries built by CI. PR #474. [broker readiness;
  verify About / readiness shows real version]
